The given project file was created in Intellij IDEA and will need to be opened in it to be used. 
The Java SDK used was 1.8.0_251.
All nessesary mavan JUnit unit test files and classes are inside the project.
Included are three text files that were tested. If you wish to add any extra, place them in the highest folder in the project, alongside the other .txt files.
A java class called Manual_Test is included if you wish to manually run the program instead of running the tests, it allows a user input for a file name (without the file extension i.e. "welcome" for Welcome.txt)

Using the example given as a template, I've assumed a word is any letter (such as a single a) or punctuation (such as &) as well as including punctuation into word length (such as 18/05/2016 being 10 letters long) and that some punctuation are excluded if they arnt part of the work (such as a full stop at the end of the word "morning.")
