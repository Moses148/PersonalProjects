Welcome.

This github page is for personal project and papers for Alexander Moses for the purpose of storage and job applications. 

Alongside those projects and papers, I will have some technical tests I performed for job applications on here.
These are just for those companies so they have easy access for them, pay no attention to them.

At the moment this page is a work in progress, Im in the process of organising the projects so they can be put on here and not look like a mess of code and files.
Till then I've included a number of papers and reports I wrote for some of these projects (if those projects needed papers and reports for submission).
Some of the reports are more on the basic side in terms of formatting and write up, those projects the many focus was just results so full professional technical reports were not needed.
